# Local Weather App

This is a Local Weather App that provides weather conditions for one of several cities. It uses Geolocation for the local city.

It is built using Semantic UI, jQuery, Geolocation API, SVG, CSS3 Animation, Ajax, and Web APIs.

## Installation

Clone the repository and change directories.

```bash
$ git https://github.com/james-priest/local-weather-app.git

No build environment is necessary. This can be run from the file system but ideally it should be run from any local http server.
